# Bluesky Web Plotting

A Dash + plotly bluesky plotting sevice/callback.

## Running examples

All the tests also function as examples.

1. Install `[dev][local]` dependencies and
2. `$ export BLUESKY_WEB_PLOTS_EXAMPLE_MODE=1`
3. Run `pytest`. Each test will remain running (so you can look around) until the local window is closed.
