## Running examples

All the tests also function as examples.

1. Install `[dev][local]` dependencies and
2. `$ export BLUESKY_WEB_PLOTS_EXAMPLE_MODE=1`
3. Run `pytest`. Each test will remain running (so you can look around) until the generated local window is closed.
4. You can also access the same plots from the browser (default [https://localhost:12354](https://localhost:12354)).
